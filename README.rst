*Implementation of a neural network to predict bike sharing rides*

Getting Started
---------------

Re-run the `notebook <https://github.com/AdmcCarthy/First_Neural_Network/blob/master/Your_first_neural_network.ipynb>`_ or 
view the `page <https://admccarthy.github.io/First_Neural_Network/>`_ describing the work.

Material used
-------------

Problem posed in Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree, see the `repository <https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning>`_ for more information.

Bike Sharing dataset is from the `UCI Machine Learning Database <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset>`_
